# Stock Guide Project

Quizbowl study guide generator. Fetches clues from qbreader, analyzes them, generates Anki-style cards, and renders HTML study pages.

## Orientation (read this before exploring)

- `output/{slug}/analysis.json` is the **source of truth** for every topic. All HTML is generated from it — **never read or edit generated `.html` files** (there are ~2,500 of them); edit the JSON or the renderer, then run `./build.sh`.
- Renderers: `lib/render/render.py` (stock.html), `lib/render/render_cards.py` (cards.html), `lib/render/render_questions.py` (questions.html), `lib/build_index.py` (index.html). Each is a Python file emitting one big HTML template.
- Pipeline: `lib/pipeline/fetch.py` (qbreader API, cached) → `lib/pipeline/parse.py` (clue extraction) → `lib/run.py` (CLI wrapper producing `clues.txt`).
- Queues: `lib/queues/topic_queue.py` (global first/second-pass queues), `lib/queues/batch_worker.py` (per-batch claim/complete). State lives in `queue/*.json`.
- Cross-refs: `lib/crossref/crossref.py` rebuilds `output/topic_index.json`; `lib/crossref/backfill_crossrefs.py` adds mechanical links; the `/crossref` skill adds semantic ones.
- Agent workflows are skills in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: `/batch`, `/first-pass`, `/second-pass`, `/cards`, `/crossref`, plus category supplements (`/literature`, `/vfa`, `/afa`, `/philosophy`, `/science`). These are the single source of truth for agent instructions.
- `lib/common.py` provides `ROOT`/`OUTPUT_DIR`/`QUEUE_DIR`/`CATEGORIES_DIR`/`SETS_DIR`/`OVERRIDES_FILE`, UTF-8 stdio, and `file_lock`. Every entry script imports it — new scripts should too.
- **Unit overview pages** (`output/_categories/{unit}/`, one per `lib/units.py` unit): agent-authored `sections.txt` + `intro.txt` are assembled into `overview.json` by `lib/sweep/author.py` (scaffold/assemble; format documented in its docstring — `> ` blurbs, `- ` nesting, `=` variant merge, `->` canonical topic). `lib/sweep/capture_questions.py` captures the unit's full question set → per-entry expandable question panels; `soundbites.json` (curated via `lib/audio/soundbites.py`, Wikimedia Commons recordings) powers ♪ audio players. Rendered by `lib/render/build_overviews.py`. Notes style: 10-20 words, relations + key works, no editorializing; consult questions.json for ambiguous/common-link answerlines.
- **Sweep sets** (`output/_sets/{set_slug}/`): `lib/sweep/build_set.py "2022 ACF Winter"` fetches a whole tournament, matches every tossup/bonus-part answerline via `lib/sweep/matcher.py` (override → exact → alias tiers, category-gated; overrides in `output/answerline_overrides.json`, keys from `lib/sweep/answerlines.normalize`), writes `set.json` + reviewable `report.json`, renders interactive `sweep.html`. `--all --rematch-only` re-matches without network (red links self-heal to blue as topics get pages).
- **Shared map** (`lib/js/map_view.js`): any page mounts it (theme.LEAFLET_TAGS + `initMapView`); one pin per location (country centroids), click → panel grouped by category / year-sorted, facet chips for group + era filtering. Live on overview + sweep pages.
- `lib/units.py` is the canonical unit registry (40 units) + `SUBCATEGORY_ALIASES` drift map; classify guides via `unit_for_guide()`, never raw subcategory strings.

## Common commands

```bash
./build.sh                                  # incremental render of everything + validate
./build.sh --force                          # full re-render
python lib/validate.py                     # health check on all analysis JSONs
python lib/queues/topic_queue.py summary    # queue counts by category
python lib/queues/batch_worker.py status    # current batch progress
python post_batch.py                       # after a batch: rebuild index + print agent prompts
python lib/sweep/freq.py UNIT               # frequency table + match status for a unit
python lib/sweep/author.py scaffold UNIT    # prep/refresh overview authoring (re-entrant)
python lib/sweep/author.py assemble UNIT    # sections.txt + intro.txt -> overview.json
python lib/sweep/capture_questions.py UNIT  # capture unit's questions for the page
python lib/render/build_overviews.py        # render overview pages (--force, --unit)
python lib/sweep/build_set.py --list-sets   # find exact qbreader set names
python lib/audio/soundbites.py search "..." # find Commons audio for soundbites.json
```

## Deferred improvements (roadmap for future sessions)

- **Template consolidation**: the renderers embed large HTML/CSS strings; shared CSS lives in `lib/render/theme.py`. Long-term, move page templates to Jinja2 files.
- **`getCardImages` is triplicated** — `lib/render/render_cards.py` (Python `_synthesize_image_cards`), its embedded JS, and `lib/js/anki_export.js`. Any card-image schema change needs all three.
- **Tests + CI**: zero tests exist. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` now runs `./build.sh` (incl. `validate.py`) on every push and deploys to GitHub Pages — next step is a golden-file render test (render a fixture topic, diff against a committed snapshot).
- **Single-load `build.py` orchestrator**: `build.sh` runs ~10 processes that each re-parse all analysis JSONs (~4x redundant parsing). Worth doing when the corpus outgrows the current ~23s forced build.
- **Wikimedia batching**: `lib/images/` fetches thumbnails one filename at a time; the Commons API accepts pipe-joined `titles=`.
- **Shared question store**: question text is now cached in three shapes — per-topic caches (`output/{slug}/*.json`), per-set packet caches (`cache/sets/`), and per-unit sweeps (`cache/unit_questions/`, `output/_categories/{unit}/questions.json`). The same question can be stored 3+ times. Build a single question store keyed by qbreader `_id` with the other artifacts referencing into it.
- **Map v2**: real `coordinates` metadata — pins currently sit at country centroids (`lib/js/map_view.js`; country click-panel and category/era facets exist). With real coords, add city-level spread and pass `coords` per item (component already supports it).
- **AFA soundbites**: extend the Commons soundbites (done for opera) to Auditory Fine Arts when that unit is authored. First add API pacing to `lib/audio/soundbites.py` searches (mirror `lib/images/` `API_DELAY`) — a curation agent burst got 429-throttled by Wikimedia in July 2026.
- **Score-clue synthesis quality**: the ABC→MP3 synthesizations behind `score_clues` are correct when they faithfully transcribe the specific clued passage, but many currently don't (56 clips across 35 topics; the 56 `[NEEDS_ABC_REVIEW]` validate warnings are related) — audit/fix the transcriptions. Once trustworthy, they're ALSO worth surfacing on AFA overview pages attached to work entries (they demonstrate the actual clued passage), alongside — not instead of — the Commons famous-excerpt soundbites (`lib/audio/soundbites.py`).
- **Next-button ordering**: currently chronological-by-year within subcategory; science/philosophy concepts have no year. When yearless topics grow, switch to tag-based clustering so related concepts are adjacent.

## Universal Rules

### Analysis Quality
- **No outside knowledge for clue content.** Only describe what the clues say. Outside knowledge is OK for: hyperlinks, identifying referenced works/people for linking, and metadata fields (year, continent, country, tags).
- Any work/subtopic mentioned **3+ times** across all clues gets its own section — no exceptions.
- Any work with **specific plot/detail clues** gets its own section regardless of count.
- The `summary` field must be non-empty — a concise paragraph covering key identifiers, most famous works, and distinguishing facts.
- Work descriptions must be **mini-paragraphs**, not one-liners like "His most famous work."
- `comprehensive_summary` must be real prose synthesizing all facts from clues.
- Sentences may contain multiple clues — separate them during analysis.
- Giveaway clues (containing "For 10/ten points") are still clues.

### Metadata
- Reference `categories.md` (project root) for correct category, subcategory, and genre names.
- **"Visual Fine Arts"**, not "Visual Arts."
- `genre` is only set for:
  - Fine Arts > Other Fine Arts: specific type from categories.md (`Architecture`, `Film`, `Photography`, `Dance`, `Jazz`, `Musicals`, `Opera`, `Misc Arts`)
  - Science > Other Science: specific field (`Math`, `Astronomy`, `Computer Science`, `Earth Science`, `Engineering`, `Misc Science`)
  - Social Science: alternate_subcategory (`Psychology`, `Anthropology`, `Economics`, `Linguistics`, `Sociology`, `Other Social Science`)
  - Leave as `""` for all other subcategories.
- `year`: birth year for people, creation/publication year for works, start year for periods. Negative for BCE.
- `year_end` (optional): end year for periods, wars, empires, movements — renders as a timeline span. Omit for people and single works.
- `coordinates` (optional): `[lat, lon]` decimal degrees for Geography and place-anchored topics (buildings, monuments). Outside knowledge OK, like `year`.
- `group` (optional): one clustering value per topic where the category supplement defines a vocabulary — science field ("Organic Chemistry"), mythology tradition ("Greek"), religion ("Buddhism"), philosophy school ("German Idealism").
- `continent`: one of Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America.
- `country`: country the topic is primarily associated with.
- `tags`: recognized movements/schools/styles only (e.g., `["Surrealism"]`). NOT broad geographic descriptors like "Japanese literature." Don't duplicate the `group` value.

## Key Paths
- `output/{slug}/analysis.json` — per-topic analysis data
- `output/{slug}/cards.json` — the topic's Anki cards (separate file; card agents write ONLY this)
- `output/{slug}/stock.html` — rendered study page
- `output/topic_index.json` — master index of all topics/works
- `queue/` — all queue JSON files (never `lib/queues/`)
- `categories.md` — valid qbreader category/subcategory names
